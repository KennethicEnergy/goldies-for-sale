Please create a folder named 'puppies' inside this 'public' directory.

Place all images for the dam, sire, and each puppy in 'public/puppies/'.

Example structure:
public/puppies/dam1-1.jpg
public/puppies/sire1-1.jpg
public/puppies/puppy1-1.jpg
public/puppies/puppy1-2.jpg
...

You can use any naming convention, but group images by puppy/dam/sire for clarity.
